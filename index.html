<h1>WAT & NAT Radio Galaxy Classification</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Radio galaxies are considered one of the most powerful astronomical objects, characterized by relativistic particle jets that emerge from the central regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They are important for understanding the creation of the cosmos and the large-scale structure of the universe. Typically, radio galaxies are classified under the Fanaroff–Riley classification: FR0, FR-I, and FR-II; this classification distinguishes radio galaxies based on their luminosity and morphology.  However, it's challenging to classify bent-tailed types such as Wide-Angle Tails (WAT) and Narrow-Angle Tails (NAT), due to their complex morphologies. 

This study aims to improve the bent-tailed radio galaxy classification. The angle formed by the two opposing jets (tails) determines whether these sources can be distinguished. The dynamics of these galaxy tails are primarily influenced by ram pressure and buoyancy forces, causing the tails to bend and an increase in density in the area behind the moving galaxy. The sources' luminosity could also influence the distinction between the WAT and NAT classes. A deep learning approach was implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify the bent-tailed radio galaxy sources. The dataset comprises a total of 1,476 bent-tailed radio sources collected from nine different references, including 948 WAT sources and 528 NAT sources. The model is trained and validated on a large dataset of radio sources using Image augmentation and cross-validation to reduce overfitting and ensure the model’s robustness across diverse observational conditions. The model will randomly select 400 images from each class. 

Preliminary results show that CNN achieves a classification accuracy of approximately 70%. Future work will focus on expanding the datasets and including the study of physical parameters to enhance the accuracy. This study will set the foundation for further advancements in the development of automated analysis of radio galaxy data, contributing to a more efficient understanding of the universe's complex structures.
